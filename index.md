Some McMaster Scientific Programming Resources
==============================================

Local Resources
---------------

* [McMaster R users mailing list](https://mailman.mcmaster.ca/mailman/listinfo/r-users-l): A general discussion listserv for getting and giving help with R
* Biodata Lunch: a weekly informal discussion group where people can get help with data analysis. Typically one person presents each week.
	* Fridays at 12:30 in LSB 213A, unless otherwise specified.
    * Join the (low traffic) [mailing list](https://mailman.mcmaster.ca/mailman/listinfo/biodatalunch-l) for reminders and announcements
	* Email <a href="mailto:bolker@mcmaster.ca">Ben Bolker</a> if you have a problem you want to present and get help on.
* [Bioinformatics & Beers](https://www.meetup.com/McMaster-Bioinformatics-Meet-Up/): Monthly social
gathering of people interested in discussing bioinformatics and data analysis.
No homework, no presenting, just get together with like-minding folk and talk
shop. 
	* Third Fridays at 4pm at the Phoenix.

Web resources
------------------

It's impossible to catalogue or curate all of the R resources available on the web. Here are a *small* number of potentially useful links:

* the RStudio web site offers a variety of [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), mostly but not exclusively tidyverse-oriented
* there are some more in the "short documents and reference cards" section of the [CRAN contributed documentation page](https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html)
* CRAN [task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) are (relatively) short guides to available R tools, organized by subject area (e.g. [econometrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Econometrics.html) or [psychometrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Psychometrics.html)) (Barry Rowlingson offers a fun [graphical version](http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/R/TaskViews/) of the same set of links)
* the [[r] tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?filter=all&sort=active)
